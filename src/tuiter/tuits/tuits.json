It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars"

Each new Tesla vehicle is equipped with eight external cameras and powerful vision processing to provide an additional layer of safety. All vehicles built for the North American market now use our camera-based Tesla Vision to deliver Autopilot features, rather than radar."

    "tuit": "SpaceX had three catastrophic failures in a row. But after the 4th run was successful, NASA decided to take a risk on Musk and awarded his company a billion-dollar contract.\n\nHis unique rocket is capable of taking off and landing back down with pinpoint accuracy, to be re-used again. It sounds crazy for an independent company to one-up the Space Shuttle, but after proving itself in the field, the rocket captured the imagination of millions"
